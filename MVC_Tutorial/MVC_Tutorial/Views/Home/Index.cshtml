<!--You could pass ANYTHING into the view, any datatype of any name, and it would assume whatever you're passing in is held inside of Model: all you need to do to access it is use the Model Keyword'-->








<!--
using System.Collections.Generic
model List<string>*

We're referencing what we passed in, names variable, with the word Model
foreach (var name in Model)
{

    name

<!--If you were just passing in an integer from your controller, you could've just coded like so instead:
atsymbolmodel int

    <h1>
    atsymbolModel
    </h1>

    And it would've printed just the integer you passed in: you're basically using model as a medium to capture what controller is passing in and then display it in the view'-->
<!--The above is referring to as Razer syntax as there's a Razer engine that converts this into HTML all on the server-side'-->
