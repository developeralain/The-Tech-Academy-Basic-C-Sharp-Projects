# C# Projects
### What is the purpose of this repository?
This repository will contain the assignments, tasks, and small projects that I complete while going through my C# course at The Tech Academy.

### Projects:
- [Car Insurance](#car-insurance)
- [TwentyOne Game](#twentyone-console-game)

#### Car Insurance Web App
Using Visual Studio, C#, and the .Net framework, created an MVC Web Application that mimicked the user-experience of getting a car insurance quote online from an insurance company: 
the application requested the user to enter information about themselves, their car, and their driving history. 
It then employed business logic to calculate a quote for the user based on the personal data provided. The user could see their quote, but a special Admin view was created to display all quotes generated for all users inclusive of user demographics. This employed full CRUD database functionality and business logic.

#### TwentyOne Console Game
using Visual Studio, C#, and the .Net framework, created a console application that emulated the game of TwentyOne aka Blackjack as would be played in a Casino (i.e. with a dealer). 
This project involved multiple classes, abstract and virtual functions, enums, overloaded methods and operators, and among other aspects it included a logging functionality to automatically tracks all cards dealt in a game inclusive of a timestamp (logged to a .txt file).
